# Social-Media-Effects

My latest project analyzing the impact of social media on human health and diseases! 
Using Python libraries, I meticulously extracted and processed data to uncover insights into the correlation between social media usage and various health conditions. From mental health challenges to lifestyle diseases, the findings shed light on the complex interplay between digital connectivity and our well-being.

To bring these insights to life, I employed Excel,Power Query for data cleaning and leveraged the power of Power BI for comprehensive data visualization. This dynamic combination allowed me to create interactive dashboards that offer a clear, concise overview of the data trends.

Privacy was a top priority throughout this project. To ensure confidentiality, I implemented a secure access system. Newcomers are greeted with a front page where they can enter a password. Only upon successful authentication do they gain access to the insightful dashboards.

Curious to explore the data? Feel free to check it out on my Kaggle account:
